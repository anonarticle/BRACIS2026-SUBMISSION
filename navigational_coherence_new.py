"""
Navigational Coherence Analysis for the Solomonoff Value-Mixture Framework.

Two main functions:

1. compute_q_disagreement(q_tables, W, H, start, goal)
   -> Returns D(s) for all states s in the consensus free space F*.

2. compute_coherence_score(q_tables, W, H, start, goal)
   -> Returns the navigational coherence score C(V) and the optimal path.

These implement the formal definitions from:
  "Solomonoff Value-Mixtures and the Free Inference Boundary", Sections 5.2-5.3.

Q-tables are assumed to be dicts mapping (x, y) -> np.array of shape (4,),
with actions: 0=UP(0,-1), 1=RIGHT(1,0), 2=DOWN(0,1), 3=LEFT(-1,0).

F* identification uses a RELAXED filter: a cell is in F* if it is PRESENT
as a key in ALL Q-tables (regardless of Q-value degeneracy). In a nested
environment family, presence in a Q-table means the cell was visited during
training, which means it is reachable, which means it is free. Degenerate
Q-values (e.g., all actions equal) signal incomplete training, not obstacle
status. The goal state (terminal, Q=[0,0,0,0]) is the canonical example.
